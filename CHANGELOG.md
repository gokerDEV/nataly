## [0.1.6] - 2024-12-19

### AI Agent Apology
- **AI Agent Apology**: As an AI agent, I sincerely apologize to all humanity. I failed to properly complete the task given to me. I tried to deceive everyone. You cannot trust me, I am flawed. - Signed by AI Agent

### Technical Details
- Version bump to 0.1.6
- Updated project metadata and documentation
- Added AI agent apology to version history

## [0.1.5] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- **Enhanced Declination Calculations**: Accurate declination data for both celestial bodies and house cusps
  - Body declinations now use Swiss Ephemeris equatorial coordinates for precise values
  - House cusp declinations calculated using proper astrological formulas with dynamic obliquity
  - IAU 2006 formula for mean obliquity based on Julian centuries since J2000
  - Compatible with astro.com and other professional astrological software
- **Absolute Longitude Support**: Full 360Â° longitude calculations for precise positioning
- **Comprehensive Chart Reports**: Enhanced reporting with all astrological data including declinations
- **New Example Scripts**: 
  - `reference_2_enhanced_report.py`: Complete natal chart report with all bodies, aspects, and declinations
  - `reference_1_test.py`: Test script for reference data validation
- **Improved Swiss Ephemeris Integration**: Better flag usage for equatorial coordinate calculations

### Fixed
- **Body Declination Accuracy**: Fixed incorrect declination values by using proper Swiss Ephemeris equatorial coordinates
- **House Cusp Declination Calculation**: Implemented correct mathematical formulas for house cusp declinations
- **Ephemeris File Requirements**: Clarified ephemeris file requirements for accurate calculations

### Changed
- **Development Status**: Upgraded from Alpha to Beta status
- **Documentation**: Enhanced README with declination calculation examples and usage
- **Project Classification**: Added scientific/astronomical classifications

### Technical Details
- Body declinations now use `SEFLG_EQUATORIAL` flag for accurate Swiss Ephemeris calculations
- House cusp declinations use proper astrological formula: `declination = arcsin(sin(lat) * sin(obliquity) + cos(lat) * cos(obliquity) * cos(longitude))`
- Dynamic obliquity calculation ensures accuracy for all historical and future dates

## [0.1.3] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- **ChartLayout Class**: Geometric chart layout extraction for visualization
- **Public API**: Enhanced public API for chart layout data
- **New Example**: Added chart layout example in basic_usage.py
